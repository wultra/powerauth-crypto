# PowerAuth Software Releases

In order to consolidate the information about the current versions, we have introduced new "Product versions" and prepared a table where product versions are mapped to library and application technical versions.

- Naming for the product versions is following: `PowerAuth YYYY.MM`, where:
    - `mm` - month of publishing, for example `11`
    - `YYYY` - year of publishing, for example `2017`
- Naming for the technical releases is following: `X.Y.Z`, where:
    - `X` is the major version. Upgraded in case of a significant change.
    - `Y` is the minor version. Upgraded with each release that contains some changes.
    - `Z` is the bugfix version. Upgraded in case a hotfix is needed in some `X.Y.*` version.
